# TimeTracker

This is a simple ASP.NET application that helps the freelance developer to keep track of time spent on projects for the eligible clients. 
The application was made in .Net Core 3.0 Preview version in Visual Studio 2019 Preview. The latest technologies were used, of which the official version will be released in September this year.
The application itself is not too demanding and served as a good example to get into the world of .Net core 3.0.
An API is created where all the logic of the application takes place.
Then Unit and Integration tests were created. After that, a frontend of the application was built using cshtml, but in the new version as .razor.
